        <h2>Pokemon Go</h2>
        <img src="images/pokemonGo.jpg" alt="screencapture of ...">
        <p><a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/pok%C3%A9mon-go/id1094591345">Pokemon Go</a> has a really nice emotional element to it that I really enjoy with the Pokemon creatures that really motivates people to 'catch them all'.This, in addition to the Pokedex makes people really want to 'fill in' the Pokemons they missed and continue to use the app. Another thing I enjoy about this app is how they display their Pokemon iin both the map and informationally. On the map they seem more personal because each Pokemon is repressented when they're neaby instead of being a generic icon. For informationally, I like how sleek and organized the interface is.</p>

        <h2>Let's Roam</h2>
        <img src="images/letsRoam.jpg" alt="screencapture of ...">
        <p><a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/lets-roam-scavenger-hunts/id1338916789">Let's Roam</a> really emphasizes gamification with their token and challenges element. I like that aspect of motivation for users. I alsso really enjoy how they implemented their map feature with an ability to see a fuller view of the map and nearby locations as well as a routing function. Thei informational interface about the places is also very well organized and the addition or a ratings system is very interesting to me. </p>
