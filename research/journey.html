    <p>Enjoyed the overall idea and liked how the project aimed to be both educational and reflective. Made note to really emphasize the informational aspect to the journey. Unlike in Pokemon Go, the location sites aren't randomly generatd but specially chosen due to their importance to the city of Davis, hence learning more about the chose sites would be essential to the heart of the project.</p>
