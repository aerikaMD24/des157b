    <h1>User Test</h1>
    <h2>Significant Observations</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Better instructions for turning on location services for safari so that the locator part works</li>
        <li>Instructions for routing was largely unnecessary and it was confusing when the the ‘you made it’ popup took a while to register</li>
        <li>The Icons for the badge page felt more like a scrapbook, suggested an animation everytime a badge is earned</li>
    </ul>
    <div id="testImgs">

    </div>
    
    <h2>Things to Update</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Update Landing Page (clear instructions for location services, introduce connection to seal)</li>
        <li>Remove instructions from routing and instead just have the static route with a reroute button and the dynamic footprints (have footprints be immediate)</li>
        <li>Find a different icon for the badge page and have an an animation for the badges when earned</li>
    </ul>
